This is an interactive student's basic feedback collection system which provides the user with a dropdown menu for choosing between an admin and a student and depending on the users choice the student will be abe to fill the feedback form while the admin will be able to access the data of the students. 

The frontend of the project is made using HTML and CSS while the backend of the project has been made using Javascript and MongoDB(Node.js) has been used for the database along with which it  stores the data and retrieves the feedback data recieved.

To summarize, the project demonstrates how to build a simple yet functional feedback portal using full-stack technologies and role-based acceess control logic.
